# ServerlessWebApp
I have created a new cloud9 instance and EC2 instance in AWS.
In the cloud9 terminal uploaded all the backend and frontend code then checked for all the code.
Created Lambda functions for both delete and get property details.
Created API for adding the property, delete and get the property values.
Finally add those api urls on to the code on the frontend with the html pages.
